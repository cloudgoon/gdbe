GDBE uses a well defined MVC design for simplicity. The following diagram displays the relevant GDBE components and how they interact with each other.

The application is broken down into distinct client (GWT) and server (AppEngine) components. The server component exposes a subset of the GData functionality to the client and is responsible for retrieving and storing authentication tokens.

==Authentication==
Authentication makes use of the AppEngine user service to Google-authenticate users. Once the user is authenticated, a GData token is obtained via the GData AuthSub mechanism which will present the user with an approve/deny access control page. Tokens obtained in this way are kept in the AppEngine data store for later use. AuthSub session tokens don't have a default expiration date, they are revoked through the GData library.

The sign-out mechanism therefore first revokes the AuthSub session token and then signs the user out via the AppEngine User service.
